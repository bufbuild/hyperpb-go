// Package fastpb is a highly optimized dynamic message library for Protobuf, which
// can generate parsers 2-3x faster than protobuf-go's generated code at
// runtime, using only reflection.
//
// To use this package, compile a [Type] using the [Compile] function. This is
// a one-time cost. The resulting value implements [protoreflect.MessageType].
//
// # Support Status
//
// This package does not implement roughly half of the protobuf-go reflection
// APIs, because it is specialized for parsing and reading only. More of the
// APIs may be implemented as time goes on. The following operations are not
// supported or not implemented:
//
//   - Unmarshaling onto an existing message.
//   - Clearing and mutating messages, including [protoreflect.Message].NewField
//     and message merging and cloning.
//   - Required field tracking (unmarshaling never fails due to missing fields).
//
// The following features are currently not implemented but there are plans
// to do so:
//
//   - Groups (groups will parse as unknown fields).

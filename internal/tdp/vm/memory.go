// pageBoundary is the alignment of the smallest physical memory page on any
// system we support (4K). If we are allowed to load memory from any address in
// a page, we assume that loading (and discarding) memory from anywhere else is
// also ok.

// RelocatePageBoundary ensures that it is always possible to read nine bytes
// beyond the end of data. This allows us to elide virtually all bounds checks
// in the parser, since it will only ever look ahead at most nine bytes (to
// parse a rare ten-byte varint).
//
// This function accomplishes this by checking that loading nine bytes from the
// end of data does not cross a 4K page boundary. If it does not, it means that
// we can always load past the end a little bit, because page protection is not
// more granular than that on any platform we care about. If this condition is
// not met, we copy the slice in such a way as to force this condition to be
// met.
//
// If forceCopy is set, this copy is performed unconditionally.
//
// Exported for use by benchmarks.

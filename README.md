# fastpb

`fastpb` is a highly optimized dynamic message library for Protobuf, which
can generate parsers over 30% faster than protobuf-go's generated code at
runtime, using only reflection.

For a detailed explanation of the implementation details of `fastpb`, see
the [`HACKING.md`](HACKING.md) file.
